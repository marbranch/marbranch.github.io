  <h1> About Me </h1>

  <p>I am a twenty-one-year-old college student from New York. Over the past two years, 
      I have gained a deeper appreciation for beauty practices. I started watchng videos 
      online more frequently where self-proclaimed professionals share their talents 
      with the world. I watched everything from nail tutorials to hair tutorials, to makeup 
      tutorials - if it is beauty, I am guaranteed to give it at least a peek. 

      In my consumption of beauty-related content, I have surpassed mere observation. At this 
      point, I have tried many of the beautiful projects that I see online - making my expectations 
      a reality. So, I would like to use this website - "Mariah's Beauty Site" to share my trials and 
      tribulations during my self-teaching beauty school escapades.
