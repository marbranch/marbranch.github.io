    <p>My love for artificial nails was born after watching Youtube videos, specifically 
      by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7GQczqE8bHDRMN233lQiLg">Emily Susanah, who is a self
        taught nail guru who posts videos for the many people just like her.</a> It is very easy
        to get fed up with overcharging nail salons that do not even offer quality work, so many 
        resort to doing their own nails for less money and more control over nail designs. So, 
        that is how I ended up being so captivated by Emily's nail videos, she did what all of us 
        think of doing, but very few end up putting their money where their mouth is. Yet, the way that 
        Emily does her nails makes great and fashionable results seem easily attainable. As a result, 
        I started my artificial nail journey with only the teachings of Emily Susanah, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChUwiyIBEbWDyKRGcYUaVNg">
    Evie from LongHairPrettyNails, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTldDNXS4GeChcmwm55mXYQ">Suzie from Nail Career Education.</a>
        </p> 

        <p>To do artificial nails, there are some decisions you must make as a technician, such as:
       what you will be building the nail with. In regards to nail-building materials, I have tried 
      acrylic [briefly], builder gel and polygel. I have had the most experience with <strong>polygel</strong>,a blend 
      of UV/LED gel and acrylic, as I have tried many techniques using that medium to achieve a beautiful set. 
      I have tried various types of forms such as: <strong>dual forms, nail tips, nail forms</strong> and I have yet to master 
      a specific technique. <strong>Dual forms</strong> are plastic shapes that polygel is squeezed onto 
      and placed on the full nail to then be cured before removing the plastic form, revealing the cured shape of the polygel. 
      <strong>Nail tips</strong> are plastic portions that are glued to the free edge of the nail. Afterwards, 
      your builder of choice is applied to the nailbed and rest of the tip to build a nail. <strong>Nail forms</strong> are 
      essentially cardboard forms that are attached to the finger and nail to build a nail from scratch. The cardboard 
      creates a 'tip' underneath the free edge so product can be applied to the free edge to extend the nail. I have tried each of these
      techniques and some are trickier than others. For example, when using nail forms, it is essential you build the apex of the nail 
      correctly, otherwise the entire structure of the nail is compromised. I try to use whatever technique is most 
      appropriate according to the amount of time I want to spend on the nails or how long I want to keep them on - sometimes 
      the best solution is to simply glue on some press on nails. Another factor a technician needs to account for is if they will be using normal nail polish or gel nail polish.
  While good ole nail polish is very accessible, cheaper, and has many selections, gel nail polish is amazing for time sensitive sets. Using regular 
  nail polish can add a lot of extra time to your set as you wait for the polish to dry whereas gel polish is dried in a mere ninety seconds
  using a LED/UV light. Gel polish is also likely to scratch or dent like regular polish because it is cured by the LED/UV light, 
  serving as a 'protective shield' for your nails. Gel polish also dries very shiny and settles automatically, preventing any 
  unsightly bumps and bubbles. 
</p>

<p>As I have learned the past couple of years, these aspects are important to consider and determine your capacity and 
  ability to do artificial nails. Using a nail building material that does not work for you or using regular polish with time 
  constraints can seriously affect whether you think you are 'good' at it or not. I have also learned that <strong>practice really does 
    make perfect,</strong> the more sets I do, the closer I will get to being 'perfect.'
</p>

<p>Now what does this have to do with the beauty world?</p>

<p>I site my interests in nails as an inspiration for my interests in hair and makeup. Within recent months, I have taken a break from 
  doing my nails due to COVID-19 (long nails are a breeding ground for bacteria) and have picked up hair and makeup instead. By not doing my nails, 
  I have deprived myself of the satisfaction that accompanies finishing a project and pretty much needed to find a new hobby. So, here I am - 
  a young woman attempting to be her own beauty salon.
